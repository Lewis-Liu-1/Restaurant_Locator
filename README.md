# Restaurant Locator

The Restaurant Locator is a sample iOS application that allows the user to locate Restaurant(s) using the user's current location (based on their latitude and longitude). The Restaurant data has been requested through the [Foursquare API](https://developer.foursquare.com/). The [Restkit](https://github.com/RestKit/RestKit) is used as the RESTful API to retrieve and parse the data.
